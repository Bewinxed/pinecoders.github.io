# Writing guidelines for PineCoders Web content

## Terminology

### Annotations
Don't use the term *annotation*, as it most probably will be phased out. We use *function* for everything that was called an annotation, except for `study()` and `strategy()`, for which we use the term *declaration statement*.

### Realtime
Use *realtime* rather than *real time* or *real-time*.

### Script
*Script* is useful when referring to both *indicators* and *strategies*.

### Study vs Indicator
Use *indicator* whenever you can, except when referring to the `study()` declaration statement itself.

Example:
> The first line of an indicator should be the `study()` declaration statement.

Note than *indicator* is understood to include only *studies*. Pine strategies should be referred to as *strategies*â€”not *indicators*.

## Style

### Bulletted or enumerated list punctiation
List elements use no ending punctiation when they are not a sentence. This also applies to the last element in the list.
Use an ending period on all list elements when they are sentences, or when the majority is.

### Capitalization of titles
We follow the TradingView standard of **capitalizing the first word only**.
