# Writing guidelines for PineCoders Web content

## Annotations
Don't use the term *annotation*, as it is most probably going to be phased out. We use *function* for everything that was called an annotation, except for `study()` and `strategy()`, for wich we use the term *declaration statement*.

## Realtime
Use *realtime* rather than *real time* or *real-time*.

## Script
*Script* is useful when referring to both *indicators* and *strategies*.

## Study vs Indicator
Use *indicator* whenever you can, except when referring to the `study()` declaration statement itself.

Example:
> The first line of an indicator should be the `study()` declaration statement.
