# Writing guidelines for PineCoders Web content

## Annotations

We don't use the term *annotation*. We use *function* for everything that was called an annotation, except for `study()` and `strategy()`, for wich we use the term *declaration statement*.

## Study vs Indicator

We try to use *indicator* whenever we can.

## Script

*Script* is useful when referring to both *indicators* and *strategies*.
