# Writing guidelines for PineCoders Web content

## Annotations

We don't use the term *annotation*. We use *function* for everything that was called an annotation, except for `study()` and `strategy()`, for wich we use the term *declaration statement*.

## Study vs Indicator

We try to use *indicator* whenever we can, except when referring to the `study()` declaration statement itself.

Example:
> The first line of an indicator should be the `study()` declaration statement.

## Script

*Script* is useful when referring to both *indicators* and *strategies*.
